## Add

1. Function that accepts two lists-of-lists of numbers and returns one list-of-lists with each of the corresponding numbers in the two given lists-of-lists added together.

- modify add to accept and "add" any number of lists-of-lists.
- raise a ValueError if the given lists-of-lists aren't all the same shape.


## Circle

2. Class that represents a circle. The circle should have a radius, a diameter, and an area. It should also have a nice string representation.

- additionally the radius should default to 1 if no radius is specified when creating a circle
- make sure when the radius of class changes that the diameter and area both change as well
- make sure to set the diameter attribute and the radius will update accordingly
- make sure that you cannot set the area (setting area should raise an AttributeError)
- make sure radius cannot be set to a negative number. Raise a ValueError exception with the error message "Radius cannot be negative".


## Starting with a vowel

3. Function that accepts a list of names and returns a new list containing all names that start with a vowel.


## Power List By Index

4. Function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new list that contains each number raised to the i-th power where i is the index of that number in the given list.


## Flatten a Matrix

5. Funtion that will take a matrix (a list of lists) and return a flattened version of the matrix.


## Reverse Difference

6. Function that accepts a list of numbers and returns a new copy of the list with the reverse of the list subtracted.


## Transpose

7. Function that accepts a list of lists and returns the transpose of the list of lists.


## Factors

8. The function get_factors returns the factors of a given number.


## Pythagorean Triples

9. Function that takes a number and returns a list of tuples of 3 integers where each tuple is a Pythagorean triple, and the integers are all less then the input number. A Pythagorean triple is a group of 3 integers a, b, and c, such that they satisfy the formula a**2 + b**2 = c**2.


## Primality

10. Funtion that returns True if a number is prime and False otherwise.


## All Together

11. Function that takes any number of iterables and strings them together.


## Interleave

12. Function that accepts two iterables and returns a generator object with each of the given items "interleaved" (item 0 from iterable 1, then item 0 from iterable 2, then item 1 from iterable 1, and so on).


## Transliteration

13. Function that takes a string in one language and transliterates each word into another language, returning the resulting string.


## Parse Number Ranges

14. Function that accepts a string containing ranges of numbers and returns a generator of the actual numbers contained in the ranges. The range numbers are inclusive.
